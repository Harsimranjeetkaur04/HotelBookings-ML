# HotelBookings-ML
Using ML techniques like Decision Trees and Random Forests to classify hotel booking statuses based on various features.

This project applies Machine Learning techniques to predict hotel reservation statusesâ€”whether a booking will be honored, canceled, or result in a no-show. The dataset contains real-world hotel booking data, and we use Decision Trees and Random Forests for classification.  

Project Overview  
- Objective: Predict hotel booking statuses based on customer and reservation details.  
- Dataset: Hotel reservation records with features like arrival date, number of nights, special requests, etc.  
- Technologies Used:  
  - Python  
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data Preprocessing)  
  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
  - Seaborn, Matplotlib (Data Visualization)  

- Machine Learning Models Implemented:
  - Decision Tree Classifier (Gini & Entropy)  
  - Random Forest Classifier
